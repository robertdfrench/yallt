# Y'allt
**Yet Another ld-wrapping Library Tracker**

Y'allt is a (hopefully) unobtrusive user-space spyware tool that monitors
usage of scientific software. It is available under the [Lesser GPL](LICENSE)

## Squad Goals

* Gather business intelligence events for reporting
* Track link dependencies of user-built applications
* Do not crash at runtime or corrupt the user's environment

## Due Credit
Y'allt is a derivative of [XALT](https://github.com/Fahey-McLay/xalt) and its
design benefits from years of production experience with XALT and its
predecessor AltD. Shout out to Mark, Robert, and Reuben.
